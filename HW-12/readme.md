- The Assignment:
This week, you should develop a sketch where objects, created from one or more classes, are “aware” of each other, and can interact with each other.

Use the examples from in class to study how to make your objects aware of each other.

You are free to create whatever you want for this sketch. If you are having a hard time coming up with ideas, perhaps consider implementing a simple game that you know of, some sort of generative pacman sketch (similar to the last page), or a “basic ecosystem” where objects search around for each other.

- The Process:
