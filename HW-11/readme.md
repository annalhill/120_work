#### Process
- For this assignment my goal is to create a ribbon ripple effect. As of right now I am starting with the bubble example given on the website to use as a comparison of what I am doing versus what should be in the homework.
- As of right now I have tow functions written and working
  1. Gives me re-occuring circles to create a "ribbon" effect
  2. The other produces a ripple effect fading into the screen and growing larger and larger
- In order to combine these I think I will take the fade effect and apply it to the construct of the ribbon to create a boolean effect within the mouseX, mouseY scroll
- I've decided to take a break and work on some other homework assignments I have stacked up this fine evening
