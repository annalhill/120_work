# HW 3: My first P5 Sketch!

### The steps I've taken:
- Downloaded the examples files with where to start the Sketch
- Created a blue canvas to work on ( not necessarily in the instructions)
- Made my canvas say "Hello World" because this is what you have to do every time you build a new webpage of any sorts
- Create an ellipse to go along with my text
- Go into the sketch that I originally made and add comments to show the class that I understand what I am doing
- In the tutorials, Dr. Musick goes over [why we have so many index.html files](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-3/discussionOnIndex/)- they declare what type of file and language we are working in and allow for the work to show in a web browser
- Making the page go live in GitHub-- I will do this once I fix my GitHub desktop and am able to commit and push my work to the sites


Overall in this HW assignment I didn't feel as though I ran into any major issues and it went quickly and smoothly!


#### Here are some notes from Dr. Musick that I should remember
1. p5- This is general p5 code.
2. sketch.js- This is p5 code that is specifically in the sketch.js file.
3. * .js/p50- This is p5 code in another file, which will be specified in place of the ‘* ’ wildcard.
4. JS or JavaScript, which specifies the code you are looking at is general JavaScript.
5. HTML- This is HTML code. You will not see this very often.
6. BASH- This is code for the command line application of your choice or OS.
  - Please remember that, you will copy or type text that comes after the dollar sign ($).
